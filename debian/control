Description: Micro-compositor for game scaling
 Gamescope wraps your games to give them scaling and fullscreen options. It
 provides a Wayland compositor to your games, but gamescope runs under both
 Wayland and X.org.
 .
 Your game sees a virtual display at the resolution you specified. You see a
 scaled view in a window or fullscreen. This is useful when either the game or
 your system do not permit running the game at native window/screen sizes. You
 can also use integer scaling to keep your pixels sharp and pixelated.
